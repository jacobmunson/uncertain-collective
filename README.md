Uncertainty-driven recommendation systems in Python.

:warning: This project is currently under development and should be used very carefully.

This project provides Pytorch based implementations of several recommendation algorithms for explicit and implicit feedback  data:

* FunkSVD factorization [https://sifter.org/~simon/journal/20061211.html]

* Confidence-aware Probabilistic Matrix Factorization [https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/11251]

* OrdRec [https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2043932.2043956]
