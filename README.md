Uncertainty-driven recommendation systems in Python.

:warning: This project is currently under development and should be used very carefully.

This project provides pytorch-lightning [:link:](https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning) based implementations of several recommendation algorithms:

* Explicit feedback:
