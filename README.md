Uncertain
=======

Uncertainty-driven recommendation systems in Python.

:warning: This project is currently under development and should be used very carefully.

This project provides pytorch-lightning [:link:](https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning) based implementations of several recommendation algorithms:

* Explicit feedback:

    * [Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (PMF)](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2007/file/d7322ed717dedf1eb4e6e52a37ea7bcd-Paper.pdf)
    
    * [Confidence-aware Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (CPMF)](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/11251)
